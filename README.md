### About Me

Hi, I'm Joy Johansson ‚Äî a detail-oriented and highly motivated Junior DevOps Engineer with a rich background spanning over two decades, including biomedical science. This unique journey has instilled in me a strong sense of precision, resilience, and a drive for continuous learning, now focused on the exciting world of DevOps.

My passion lies in building secure, scalable, and maintainable systems through a deep understanding of cloud infrastructure, particularly Microsoft Azure, and container orchestration with Kubernetes. I'm dedicated to automating processes and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines to streamline development workflows.

üöÄ **Currently Engaged With:** Azure, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (Bicep, Ansible)
‚öôÔ∏è **Expertise In:** CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitLab), containerisation (Docker), monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus), platform security, and scripting (Python, PowerShell, YAML).
üìö **Recent Training:** Completed Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) training at Elastisys. Currently pursuing Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification.
‚úçÔ∏è **Publications:** Authored several articles on DevOps methodologies and tools, sharing insights and experiences.
üéì **Education:** MSc in Biomedical Science, complemented by a strong foundation in DevOps from Jensen Higher Vocational Education.
üí¨ **Let's Discuss:** Debugging cluster issues, securing container images, writing clean YAML, or simply learning out loud. Keen to explore Kubernetes patterns, GitOps workflows (ArgoCD, Helm Charts), and CI/CD orchestration.
‚ö° **Fun Fact:** I took up figure skating as an adult ‚Äî because learning never stops!
