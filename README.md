👩‍🔬 From Biomedical Science to DevOps – Analysis, Structure & Automation 
With an MSc in biomedical science and 24 years of professional experience, I’ve transitioned from medical documentation to DevOps. My analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, honed in highly regulated environments, now drive my passion for automation, security, and system integration.  

🛠️ Technical Skills & Tools  
✅ Kubernetes – Orchestration & scalable infrastructure  
✅ CI/CD– GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD  
✅ Ansible & Docker– Configuration & containerisation  
✅ Azure & Azure DevOps – Cloud infrastructure & CI/CD

🏆 Leadership & Mentorship 
Coaching and guiding others has been a recurring theme throughout my career. As a former swimming instructor, I taught children and adults to navigate water confidently. Now, I continue as an assistant coach in gymnastics and will soon begin coaching athletics (ages 5–7). These experiences sharpen my ability to instruct, motivate, and support – essential skills in my DevOps journey.
